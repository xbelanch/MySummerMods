# Tools

List of tools you'll need to develop mods for My Summer Car. Don't hesitate for opening an issue to suggest a tool not included on that list.

* [Unity 5.0.0f4 (64-bit)](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive): self explanatory.
* [Mod Loader Pro](https://mscloaderpro.github.io/): A mod loader for My Summer Car.
* [MSCEditor](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/8): MSCEditor is a save-file editor for My Summer Car. It enables the user to modify their save-files as they please. Common use cases include teleporting objects, cheating in money and diagnosing problems with your car.
* [ILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy): ILSpy is the open-source .NET assembly browser and decompiler.
* [Unity Assets Bundle Extractor](https://github.com/DerPopo/UABE/releases): UABE is an editor for Unity 3.4+/4/5/2017/2018 .assets and AssetBundle files. It can create standalone mod installers from changes to .assets and/or bundles.
* [Unity Assets Explorer [v 1.3]](https://zenhax.com/viewtopic.php?t=36): Unity Assets Explorer is used to view the contents of Assets-files (Unity 3D engine).
* [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony): Harmony gives you an elegant and high level way to alter the functionality in applications written in C#. It works great in games and is well established in titles like 7 Days To Die, BattleTech, Besiege, Cities:Skylines, Kerbal Space Program, Oxygen Not Included, Ravenfield, Rimworld, Sheltered, Stardew Valley, Staxel, Subnautica, The Ultimate Nerd Game, Total Miner, Unturned and many more.
* [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy): A debugger and .NET assembly editor. You can use it to edit and debug assemblies even if you don't have any source code available. The project is since 2020 discontinued.
* [uTinyRipper](https://github.com/mafaca/UtinyRipper): Tool for extracting assets from serialized files (CAB-, *.assets, *.sharedAssets, etc.) and assets bundles (.unity3d, *.assetbundle, etc.) and conveting them into native Engine format.
* [Developer Toolset II](https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/345): A mod tool designed to give you a detailed overview of all objects, components and variables the game uses.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): as main code editor. Works pretty well and better on Windows than Emacs.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/es/vs/community/): As I said that's the ide recommended for the Mod Loader Pro developer team.
